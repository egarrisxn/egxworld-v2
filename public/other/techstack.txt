My Tech Stack:
I build dynamic web applications using JavaScript, Next.js, and React, with Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, shadcn/ui for crafting accessible UIs. Canva is my go-to for design, while Sanity and MDX manage content. I rely on Node.js for server-side logic and pnpm for package management. My development setup includes ESLint and Prettier for code quality, Webpack for bundling, and Vercel for deploying. Git and VS Code are central to my version control and coding workflows.
