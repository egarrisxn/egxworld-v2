```jsx
import React, {useState, useMemo} from 'react'

function ExpensiveComponent({count}) {
  const computeExpensiveValue = (num) => {
    console.log('Computing...')
    let result = 0
    for (let i = 0; i < 1e6; i++) {
      result += num * i
    }
    return result
  }

  // Memoize the expensive computation
  const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(count), [count])

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Computed Value: {expensiveValue}</p>
    </div>
  )
}

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <ExpensiveComponent count={count} />
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

### Understanding `useMemo`

The `useMemo` Hook helps optimize performance by memoizing values, preventing unnecessary recalculations during renders. Introduced in React 16.8, it improves efficiency by:

- **Memoizing Values**: `useMemo` takes a function and an array of dependencies. It recomputes the value only when dependencies change.

### Example

In the example above, `useMemo` is used to optimize a costly computation. Without it, `computeExpensiveValue` runs on every render. With `useMemo`, it recalculates only when `count` changes, boosting performance.

### Benefits

- **Performance Optimization**: Avoids redundant calculations.
- **Prevents Unnecessary Renders**: Helps avoid re-renders of components that depend on memoized values.
- **Efficient Resource Use**: Reduces computation and rendering overhead.

### When to Use

- **Expensive Calculations**: For costly operations or data transformations.
- **Rendering Optimization**: To prevent unnecessary re-renders.

### Conclusion

`useMemo` is essential for enhancing React app performance by memoizing expensive computations and reducing unnecessary renders. Try it in your projects to see improvements in efficiency and responsiveness.
