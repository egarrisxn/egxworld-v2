```jsx
import React, {useState} from 'react'

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Counter
```

### Understanding the Power of React Hooks

React Hooks were introduced in React 16.8, and they have since revolutionized the way developers manage state and side effects in functional components. Before Hooks, state management in React required class components, which could be cumbersome and verbose. With Hooks, you can easily add state and other React features to functional components, making your code cleaner and more reusable.

### What are React Hooks?

React Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. There are several built-in Hooks, such as `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`, each serving a specific purpose.

#### A Simple Example: `useState`

One of the most commonly used Hooks is `useState`. It allows you to add state to your functional components. See above example.
