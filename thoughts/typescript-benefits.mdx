```tsx
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`
}

// Example usage
const greeting = greet('TypeScript')
console.log(greeting) // Output: Hello, TypeScript!

// This will throw an error at compile-time:
// const invalidGreeting = greet(42)
```

## Benefits of Using TypeScript

TypeScript brings static typing to JavaScript, helping developers catch errors early in the development process. In the example above, the greet function expects a string as an argument. Passing a value of the wrong type, such as a number, results in a compile-time error instead of a runtime bug.

By adding types, you make your code self-documenting and easier to refactor as your project grows.
